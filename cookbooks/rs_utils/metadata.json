This is to support any legacy recipes as well as allow the input to be manipulated in the RS dashboard.\n\nSyntax:\n\n```rs_utils_enable_collectd_plugin \"curl_json\"```\n\n\nrs_utils_monitor_process\n------------------------------------\n* Accepts only one parameter, \"name\" which is the name of the process to monitor\n* The process name is added to node[:rs_utils][:process_list_ary] which is used to create the list of processes in the /etc/collectd/conf/processes.conf file\n* The node[:rs_utils][:process_list_ary] will have any processes listed in node[:rs_utils][:process_list] merged into it.  This is to support any legacy recipes as well as allow the input to be manipulated in the RS dashboard.\n\nSyntax:\n\n```rs_utils_monitor_process \"nginx\"```\n\n\nrs_utils_marker\n------------------------------------\n* Accepts only one parameter, \"location\" which can be :start or :end.
