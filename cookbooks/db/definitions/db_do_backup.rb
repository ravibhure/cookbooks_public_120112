# == Does a snapshot backup of the filesystem containing the database
# Note that the upload becomes a background job in order to allow other recipes to
# not wait if the upload takes a long time.
# Since this backup is a snapshot of a filesystem, it will check if the database has
# been 'initialized', else it will fail.
# == Params
# force(Boolean):: If false, if a backup is currently running, will error out stating so.
#   If true, if a backup is currently running, will kill that process and take over the lock.
# backup_type(String):: If 'primary' will do a primary backup using node attributes specific
#   to the main backup.  If 'secondary' will do a secondary backup using node attributes for
#   secondary.  Secondary uses 'ROS'.
# == Exceptions
# If force is false and a backup is currently running, will raise an exception.
# If database is not 'initialized', will raise.
