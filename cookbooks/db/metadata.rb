recipe "db::default", "Adds the database:active=true tag to your server which identifies it as an database server. The tag is used by application servers to identify active databases. It also loads the required 'db' resources."

recipe  "db::install_client", "Installs the database client onto the VM so that it can connect to a running server.  It should be set up on all database servers and servers intended to connect to the servers."

recipe  "db::install_server", "Installs and sets up the packages that are required for database servers."

recipe  "db::setup_monitoring", "Installs the collectd plugin for database monitoring support, which is required to enable monitoring and alerting functionality for your servers."


# == Common Database Recipes
#
recipe  "db::setup_block_device", "Relocates the database data directory onto a block_device that supports snapshot backup and restore functionality. This script should be run on a newly operational server before it get placed into production."

recipe  "db::do_backup", "Creates a backup of the database using persistent storage in the current cloud.  On Rackspace, LVM backups are uploaded to the specified CloudFiles container.  For all other clouds, volume snapshots (like EBS) are used."
recipe  "db::do_restore", "Restores the database from the most recently completed backup available in persistent storage of the current cloud."

recipe "db::do_backup_schedule_enable", "Enables db::do_backup to be run periodically."
recipe "db::do_backup_schedule_disable", "Disables db::do_backup from being run periodically."

recipe  "db::setup_privileges_admin", "Adds the username and password for 'superuser' privileges."
recipe  "db::setup_privileges_application", "Adds the username and password for application privileges."

recipe  "db::do_secondary_backup", "Creates a backup of the database and uploads it to a secondary cloud storage location, which can be used to migrate your database to a different cloud.  For example, you can save a secondary backup to an AWS S3 bucket or a Rackspace CloudFiles container."
recipe  "db::do_secondary_restore", "Restores the database from the most recently completed backup available in a secondary location."

recipe  "db::do_force_reset", "Resets the database back to a pristine state. WARNING: Execution of this script will delete any data in your database!"


# == Database Firewall Recipes
# 
recipe "db::do_appservers_allow", "Allows connections from all application servers in the deployment that are tagged with appserver:active=true tag. This script should be run on a database server so that it will accept connections from application servers."

recipe "db::do_appservers_deny", "Denies connections from all application servers in the deployment that are tagged with appserver:active=true tag.  This script can be run on a database server to deny connections from all application servers in the deployment."

recipe "db::request_appserver_allow", "Sends a request to allow connections from the caller's private IP address to all database servers in the deployment that are tagged with the database:active=true tag. This should be run on an application server before attempting a database connection."

recipe "db::request_appserver_deny", "Sends a request to deny connections from the caller's private IP address to all database servers in the deployment that are tagged with the database:active=true tag. This should be run on an application server upon decommissioning."


# == Master/Slave Recipes

recipe "db::setup_replication_privileges", "Set up privileges for MySQL replication slaves."
recipe "db::request_master_allow", "Sends a request to the master database server tagged with rs_dbrepl:master_instance_uuid=<master_instance_uuid> to allow connections from the server's private IP address.  This script should be run on a slave before it sets up replication."
recipe "db::request_master_deny", "Sends a request to the master database server tagged with rs_dbrepl:master_instance_uuid=<master_instance_uuid> to deny connections from the server's private IP address.  This script should be run on a slave when it stops replicating."

recipe "db::handle_demote_master", "Remote recipe executed by do_promote_to_master. DO NOT RUN."
